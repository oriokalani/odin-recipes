    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic butter salmon is a delightful dish that combines the rich, buttery flavor of salmon with the aromatic essence of garlic.

The preparation involves melting butter in a pan, saut√©ing minced garlic until fragrant, and then cooking the salmon fillets until they reach the desired doneness. The result is a beautifully golden and flavorful piece of fish that pairs well with a variety of sides, such as steamed vegetables, rice, or a fresh salad.
