    <p>Caesar salad is a classic dish known for its crisp romaine lettuce and creamy, tangy dressing. The salad is traditionally topped with crunchy croutons and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, adding texture and flavor. The dressing, a key component of the dish, is typically made with ingredients like egg yolk, lemon juice, garlic, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies, creating a rich and savory profile. This combination of fresh greens and bold dressing makes Caesar salad a popular choice for both a starter and a main course.</p>
