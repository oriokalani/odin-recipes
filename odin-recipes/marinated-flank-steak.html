    <h1>Marinated Flank Steak</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Marinated flank steak is a flavorful and tender dish that's perfect for a quick and satisfying meal. The key to this recipe is the marinade, which typically consists of a blend of soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, lime juice, and various herbs and spices. This combination not only infuses the meat with a rich, savory flavor but also helps to tenderize the flank steak, which can be a tougher cut. The steak is usually marinated for at least a few hours, or even overnight, to ensure the flavors deeply penetrate the meat.</p>
    <p>Once marinated, the flank steak is grilled or broiled to perfection, allowing the exterior to develop a deliciously charred crust while keeping the inside juicy and tender. The steak is often sliced thinly against the grain to enhance its tenderness and is typically served with sides such as grilled vegetables, a fresh salad, or a hearty grain like quinoa or rice. This dish is not only versatile and easy to prepare but also a crowd-pleaser, making it an excellent choice for both family dinners and entertaining guests.</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
